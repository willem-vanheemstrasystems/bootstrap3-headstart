#Getting Started with Bootstrap

Bootstrap 3 is using a methodology called 'Mobile First'.

See http://getbootstrap.com

Bootstrap 3 is all about ***responsive layouts***. This allows sites and applications to be viewed on just about any device and not have to sacrifice quality.

This is done with media queries and fluid layouts.

Bootstrap uses LESS to compile CSS.
